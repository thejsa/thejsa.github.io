I'm always up for a chat, whether it be a quick question about some code or a long conversation about whether vanilla ice cream is better than salted caramel. (Salted caramel FTW!)
You can find me on GitHub {% include icon-github.html username="thejsa" %}, email - josh.kelly27@outlook.com - and on GBAtemp under the username jsa.
