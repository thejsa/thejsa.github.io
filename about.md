Hi there! I'm jsa, an independent web dev who also likes to tinker with 3DS homebrew applications.
I make a lot of web apps for the 3DS browser, too. I should list them at some point, hehehe.

I'm on GitHub (as you may have guessed) - my username is {% include icon-github.html username="thejsa" %}.
You can also email me at josh.kelly27@outlook.com.
